The seminar will be highly interactive and a high degree of student participation and initiative is expected. Students will read a broad selection of literature as a springboard to discuss the challenges and realities of practice with scientists, natural resource managers, activist citizens, and senior level federal policy makers. Early in the semester we will discuss options for projects and papers. Completed student projects and papers will be featured on the MIT-USGS Science Impact Collaborative (MUSIC) Web site.
